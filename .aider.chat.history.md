```
Idea: A lightweight web app that shows the trend (bullish / bearish / sideways) for selected coins based on simple indicators.
User goal: Quickly understand what’s happening in the market without opening a bunch of charts.
Core features (MVP):

* Connection to an exchange API (Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, etc.).
* Coin list with a trend indicator (icons / colors).
* Basic indicators: EMA, RSI, MACD (on 1–2 timeframes, e.g., 1h and 4h).
* Simple dashboard with filters: by trend, volume, volatility.

Development plan:

1. Choose an exchange and integrate its public market data API.
2. Implement indicator calculations (on the backend or directly in the frontend).
3. Build a simple UI: coin table + trend status.
4. Add filters and sorting.
5. Deploy as a web app (e.g., Vercel/Netlify).

I need to edit the app metadata file to change the title and description, and I’ll create a new logo image‑generation file.  
Please add the current contents of **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** to the chat so I can propose the exact replacement. Once that file is added, I’ll provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes and the new `logo.png.todo` file.
