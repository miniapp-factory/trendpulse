+Code the following app
+```
+Idea: A lightweight web app that shows the trend (bullish / bearish / sideways) for selected coins based on simple indicators.
+User goal: Quickly understand what’s happening in the market without opening a bunch of charts.
+Core features (MVP):
+
+* Connection to an exchange API (Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, etc.).
+* Coin list with a trend indicator (icons / colors).
+* Basic indicators: EMA, RSI, MACD (on 1–2 timeframes, e.g., 1h and 4h).
+* Simple dashboard with filters: by trend, volume, volatility.
+
+Development plan:
+
+1. Choose an exchange and integrate its public market data API.
+2. Implement indicator calculations (on the backend or directly in the frontend).
+3. Build a simple UI: coin table + trend status.
+4. Add filters and sorting.
+5. Deploy as a web app (e.g., Vercel/Netlify).
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
